# TMRC Dictionary

Git-versioned 1959 and 1960 TMRC Dictionaries by [Pete Sampson](http://www.gricer.com/tmrc/tmrc-dictionary-intro.html):

> TMRC is the Tech Model Railroad Club of MIT. Its clubroom, in a building on the MIT campus, had a large model train layout, with various operating positions connected to the trains by a 1200-relay switching system.

> I joined the club in the fall of 1958, and in June of 1959 wrote the first edition of the TMRC Dictionary. A little over a year later, I updated it to a second edition. It should be noted that the Dictionary was intended to be humorous. Each entry was thought to be funny: some are puns, some are irreverent reflections on TMRC culture, and a few are more or less straight definitions that seemed amusing to me in their own right. To explain these entries I have now annotated both editions.

> Many members suggested words to be listed, though nearly all the text is mine. Entries are marked where I recall other members provided the wording; if readers can identify other such entries, that information would be welcome.
